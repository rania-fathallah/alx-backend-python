# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on learning how to write and implement both unit and integration tests in Python. Testing is an essential part of software development as it ensures code reliability, helps catch bugs early, and makes it easier to maintain and refactor code over time. The project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and is aimed at developing best practices for writing tests and ensuring code quality.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the importance of testing and the differences between unit tests and integration tests.
- Write unit tests using Python's `unittest` module.
- Use `parameterized` to test multiple inputs for a function.
- Mock external dependencies to isolate tests.
- Apply various testing techniques, including edge cases and exception testing.
- Write integration tests to test how different modules in your application interact with each other.
