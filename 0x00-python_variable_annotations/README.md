# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

This project focuses on understanding and using type annotations in Python. Type annotations help improve code readability and maintainability by specifying the expected data types for variables, function arguments, and return values.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose of type annotations in Python
- Use basic type annotations for variables, functions, and function return types
- Work with complex data types, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Apply type annotations for function arguments with default values
- Use type aliasing to simplify annotations for complex types

## Project Structure

The project consists of several Python scripts, each demonstrating different aspects of type annotations:

- `0-add.py`: A function that adds two floating-point numbers with type annotations.
- `1-concat.py`: A function that concatenates two strings, with annotated argument types and return type.
- `2-floor.py`: A function that returns the floor of a floating-point number, with appropriate type annotations.
- `3-to_str.py`: A function that converts a floating-point number to a string, with annotations.
- `4-define_variables.py`: Demonstrates variable annotations for various data types.
- `5-sum_list.py`: A function that takes a list of floats and returns their sum, with type annotations.
- `6-sum_mixed_list.py`: A function that works with a list containing both integers and floats, and returns their sum.
- `7-to_kv.py`: A function that converts a tuple containing a string and a number to a key-value pair.
- `8-make_multiplier.py`: A higher-order function that returns a function for multiplying a float by a given multiplier.
- `9-element_length.py`: Demonstrates the use of type annotations with a function that returns a list of tuples containing elements and their lengths.
- `100-safe_first_element.py`: Shows the use of `Optional` for functions that may return `None`.
- `101-safely_get_value.py`: Demonstrates the use of `TypeVar` for type-safe function annotations.
- `102-type_checking.py`: Introduces the use of `mypy` for static type checking and handling type hints in complex scenarios.
